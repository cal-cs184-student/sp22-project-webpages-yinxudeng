		<h1>Project 3-2</h1>

		<section>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				For Part 1, we follow the instructions in the spec to implement BSDF for mirror and 
				glass materials. One problem we encounter is that we forget to use the absolute 
				value of the cosine term, and we are able to fix it quickly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For part 4, we follow the instructions in the spec to implement an algorithm to 
				generate ray for the thin-lens camera model.

			<h2>Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>
			<p>Questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Show a sequence of six images of scene CBspheres.dae rendered with max_ray_depth 
					set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100. The other settings should be at least 64 
					samples per pixel and 4 samples per light. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Answers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Here is a sequence of seven images rendered with max_ray_depth set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 
					4, 5, and 100 respectively.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<img src="./images/spheres_64_4_0.png" style="width:480px">
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./images/spheres_64_4_1.png" style="width:480px">
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./images/spheres_64_4_2.png" style="width:480px">
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./images/spheres_64_4_3.png" style="width:480px">
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./images/spheres_64_4_4.png" style="width:480px">
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./images/spheres_64_4_5.png" style="width:480px">
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./images/spheres_64_4_100.png" style="width:480px">
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 0, we see the ceiling lights. 
						</li>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 1, we see the walls, the floor, the 
							reflections off the two spheres, and the shadows beneath the two spheres. 
						</li>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 2, we see the ceiling, the reflection of CB 
							on the mirror sphere, and a little bit lighting through the glass sphere. 
						</li>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 3, we see the glass sphere and the bright 
							spot beneath the glass sphere. 
						</li>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 4, we see the glass sphere on the surface of 
							the mirror sphere and the bright spot on the right wall. 
						</li>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 5, the image looks more realistic and bright, 
							but there is no significant change. 
						</li>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 100, the image looks even more realistic and 
							bright, but there is no significant change. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 0, we only see lights from the ceiling light. 
						</li>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 1, we can see lights bouncing once off the 
							wall, or the mirror sphere, or the glass sphere. Some lights go inside 
							the glass sphere, which is why the reflection of the ceiling light looks 
							broken into pieces on the glass sphere's surface. 
						</li>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 2, we can see lights bouncing once off some 
							objects and bouncing another time off the ceiling so we can now see the 
							ceiling. We can also see lights bouncing once off some objects and 
							bouncing another time off the mirror sphere so we can now see the 
							reflection of the CB on the surface of the mirror sphere. We can also 
							see a little bit of lights going through the surface of the glass sphere 
							twice before entering the camera. 
						</li>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 3, we can see lights bouncing once off some 
							objects and going through the surface of the glass sphere twice so we can 
							now see the glass sphere very clearly. We can also see lights going 
							through the surface of the glass sphere twice and bouncing once off the 
							floor so we can see a bright spot beneath the glass sphere. 
						</li>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 4, we can see lights bouncing once off some 
							objects and going through the surface of the glass sphere twice and 
							bouncing another time off the mirror sphere so we can see the reflection 
							of the glass sphere on the mirror sphere's surface clearly. We can also 
							see lights bouncing once off the mirror sphere and going through the 
							surface of the glass sphere twice and bouncing another time off the right 
							wall so we can see a bright spot on the right wall. 
						</li>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 5, the image looks more realistic and bright, 
							but there is no significant change. 
						</li>
						<li>
							When max_ray_depth is set to 100, the image looks even more realistic and 
							bright, but there is no significant change.

			<h2>Part 4: Depth of Field</h2>
			<p>Questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a 
					thin-lens camera model. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Show a "focus stack" where you focus at 4 visibly different depths through a 
					scene. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Show a sequence of 4 pictures with visibly different aperture sizes, all focused 
					at the same point in a scene. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Answerw:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					In a pinhole camera model, everything is in focus. In a thin-lens camera model 
					where the lens has focal length equal to focalLength, only objects focalLength 
					away from the lens are in focus, and everything else will be out of focus and 
					look blurry. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The following four images have focalLength set to 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, and 5.0. 
					<ul>
						<li>
							<img src="./images/CBdragon_focal_length_1.png" style="width:480px">
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./images/CBdragon_focal_length_2.png" style="width:480px">
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./images/CBdragon_focal_length_3.png" style="width:480px">
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./images/CBdragon_focal_length_4.png" style="width:480px">
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					The following four images have aperture set to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<img src="./images/CBdragon_aperture_1.png" style="width:480px">

						<li>
							<img src="./images/CBdragon_aperture_2.png" style="width:480px">
