			<h2>Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h2>
			<p>Questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate 
					Bezier curves. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control 
					points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Show screenshots of each step / level of the evaluation from the original control points 
					down to the final evaluated point. Press E to step through. Toggle C to show the completed 
					Bezier curve as well. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Show a screenshot of a slightly different Bezier curve by moving the original control 
					points around and modifying the parameter t via mouse scrolling. 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Answers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Given a list of n input points and a parameter t between 0 and 1, de Casteljau's algorithm 
					performs linear interpolation between every two adjacent points: the left point is given the 
					weight of (1 - t) and the right point is given the weight of t. The output should be a list 
					of n - 1 points. We repeat this process until the list of points has length of 1, and that 
					point will be on the Bezier curve. We can then vary the value of t from 0 to 1, which will 
					trace out the entire Bezier curve. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The Bezier curve with 6 control points is in bzc/cirve3.bzc.

			<h2>Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h2>
			<p>Questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented 
					it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Show a screenshot of bez/teapot.bez (not .dae) evaluated by your implementation. 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Answers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Given n x n input points and parameters u, v between 0 and 1, we apply de Casteljau algorithm 
					to each row using the parameter u, and this will return n points with one point from each row. 
					Next, we apply de Casteljau algorithm again to these n points using the parameter v, and this 
					will return a point that resides on the Bezier surface. By varying u, v from 0 to 1, we can 
					trace out the entire Bezier surface. In my implementation, BezierPatch::evaluate1D(...) 
					iteratively calls BezierPatch::evaluateStep(...) until the input list of points is reduced to 
					length of 1. My program then calls BezierPatch::evaluate1D(...) on each row of the input 
					points and append the output points to a vector called points_in_each_row. Next, my program 
					calls BezierPatch::evaluate1D(...) one more time on points_in_each_row to output the point on 
					the Bezier surface.

			<h2>Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h2>
			<p>Questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Show screenshots of dae/teapot.dae comparing teapot shading with and without vertex 
					normals. Use Q to toggle default flat shading and Phong shading. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Answers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Suppose we are trying to find the area-weighted vertex normals at vertex O, and one of its 
					incident triangles is tirangle AOB, where OA comes before OB in the clockwise direction. 
					By definition, the cross product OB x OA yields a vector perpendicular to tirangle AOB 
					(right-hand rule: index finger - OB, middle finger - OA, thumb - OB x OA) and has magnitude 
					equal to twice the area of triangle AOB. In other words, for any triangle incident on 
					vertex O, its area-weighted normal is equal to 1/2 * (cross product of two edge vectors 
					incident on O). Therefore, to find the area-weighted vertex normals at vertex O, we simply 
					traverse all triangles incident on vertex O and calculate the cross products as described 
					above for each triangle before summing them up and normalizing it.

			<h2>Part 4: Edge Flip</h2>
			<p>Questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting 
					implementation / debugging tricks you have used. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Show screenshots of the teapot before and after some edge flips. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Answers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					As suggested in the spec, I draw a simple triangle mesh before and after the edge flip. 
					Starting from the input edge, we can traverse 10 halfedges, 4 vertices, 5 edges, and 2 
					faces in the simple mesh before the edge flip. Next, we check whether any of the faces 
					is on the boundary. If neither face is on the boundary, we look at how the edge flip 
					affects these mesh elements and reset all their pointers to the correct values. If 
					either face is on the boundary, no edge is flipped, and the input edge is returned.

					split affects all the mesh elements and reset all their pointers to the correct values. 
					If either face is on the boundary, we create the following new mesh elements: 4 
					halfedges, 1 vertex, 2 edges, and 1 face. We then look at how the edge split affects all

			<h2>Part 6: </h2>
			<p>Questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting 
					implementation / debugging tricks you have used. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave 
					after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this 
					effect by pre-splitting some edges?
				</li>
				<li>
					Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice 
					that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-
					process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? 
					Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your preprocessing 
					helps alleviate the effects. 
				</li>
				<li>
					If you have implemented any extra credit extensions, explain what you did and document 
					how they work with screenshots. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Answers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					My implementation of loop subdivision consists of 5 steps as suggested by the comments 
					in the skeleton code. First, we compute new positions for all the vertices in the input 
					mesh and store them in Vertex::newPosition. Second, we compute positions associated with 
					each edge since a new vertex will be inserted at each edge's midpoint soon, and we store 
					this information in Edge::newPosition. Third, we iterate through every edge in the mesh 
					and split the edge if it is old and has two old vertices. Also, after an edge is split, 
					we update the newly created vertex's newPosition to the edge's newPosition. Fourth, we 
					iterate through every edge in the mesh and flip the edge if it is new and has one old 
					vertex and one new vertex. Fifth, we iterate through every vertex in the mesh and update 
					their Vertex::position to Vertex::newPosition. I had some problems updating vertices' 
					positions, and it was helpful helpful to print them out. That helped me realize I was 
					doing integer arithmetic rather than float arithmetic. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The overall shape of the mesh becomes more and more round after each loop subdivision, 
					and corners and edges lose their sharpness over time as well. This happens because in 
					each loop subdivision, we update each vertex's position to a weighted average of their 
					neighbors. Initially, the vertices are relatively far away from each other, so their 
					new positions will bring them closer together. If we want to preserve sharp corners 
					and edges, we should split mesh edge elements around sharp corners and edges so that 
					their new positions are still close to their old positions. If we look at the following 
					sequence of screenshots, we observe that corners and edges with sparse mesh edge 
					elements around them lose their sharpness over time and that corners and edges with 
					dense mesh edge elements around them preserve their sharpness over time.

				<li>
					Although the cube has a symmetric geometry, it does not have a symmetric topology; in 
					other words, the edge elements of the cube are not symmetric. This is why the cube 
					becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated loop subdivisions. In order to alleviate 
					the effects, we could split the diagonal edge on each of the six faces so that each 
					face has two diagonals and the cube ends up with a symmetric topology. The visual 
					effects are shown in the following sequence of screenshots.
